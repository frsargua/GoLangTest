# GoLangTest

To test this endpoint use:

I chose to use an MVC-like (Model-View-Controller) style structure because it's clean and easy to work with. It helps keep everything organized, making it simpler to maintain and expand the code.

Square shape : http://localhost:8150/spots?latitude=-0.139305&longitude=51.4912174&radius=100000&isCircle=false
Circular shape : http://localhost:8150/spots?latitude=-0.139305&longitude=51.4912174&radius=100000&isCircle=true

Challenges I faced during this project:

Connecting DBeaver to PostgreSQL was quite a struggle and took me a while to figure out. It was the most time-consuming part of the project.

As someone coming from a C#, JavaScript, and TypeScript background, I initially found the syntax of Go a bit confusing. However, I managed to overcome this hurdle by diving into the documentation and doing plenty of Google searches. I also found some great tutorials that helped me get up to speed with Go and building servers. Surprisingly, it reminded me a lot of working with Node.js and JavaScript.

Understanding how to use postGIS was another challenge since I had never worked with it before. Coming from a MySQL background, it was a bit of a learning curve. However, I found some useful resources that made it easier to grasp.
